        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <i>web browser</i>. It can be assisted by technologies such as <b><i>Cascading Style Sheets css</i></b> and scripting languages such as <i>JavaScript</i>.

            Web browsers receive <b>HTML</b> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <b><i>HTML</i></b> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document</p>
